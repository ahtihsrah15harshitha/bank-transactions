Mission 99.1 - SynHack 3.0 Demo Script (1-2 minutes)

1) Intro (10s)
Hi, we're Mission 99.1. Our project: 'Layering of Bank Accounts - AI-Driven Money Laundering Detection'.

2) Problem (15s)
Layering is used to obscure illicit funds by moving money across multiple accounts quickly. Investigators face huge transaction volumes and fragmented data.

3) Solution (20s)
We present an interactive graph-based explorer (Streamlit) that highlights suspicious multi-hop transfers automatically, enabling quick triage.

4) Demo (40-60s)
- Open app: it auto-focuses on suspicious chains.
- Filters: search by account ID, name, email or phone.
- Hover nodes to view account details and click suspicious transactions to inspect timestamps/amounts.
- Explain how 2-4 hop chains are flagged in red.

5) Impact & Next steps (15s)
Faster investigations, reduced false positives, and easy integration with real bank feeds and ML scoring.

Thank you!
